Birdfeeders, a.k.a. from-scratch tools

These are tools I make myself for fun or learning. The name birdfeeder is derived from "A Parable on the Importance or Tools; or, Build your own fucking birdfeeder." from the Rt. Rvd. Pastor Manul Laphroaig. I recommend reading it here: https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo/blob/master/contents/articles/02-02.pdf

Much of these tools are being derived from Black Hat Go.
